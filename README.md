# Weekday From Date

A small Python program that calculates the day of the week for a given date.

## What this does
This program takes a date, month, and year as input and returns the day.

## Why I made this
I made this while practicing basic Python, then, in a random discussion on a type of question in competitive exams,  learned about a formula that can be used
to find the day of the week from a given date. I wanted to see if I could turn that idea into
a working program.

## How it works
The program:
- Takes date and year input from the user
- Uses a dictionary to store month codes
- Applies a formula to calculate a day number
- Converts that number into a weekday
